                <h3>The latest news and announcements from our team at Javis Farm Shop</h3>
                <p>When Javis Farm Shop was launched in 2006, it was out of a genuine passion for providing good quality fresh, locally sourced food and drink.
                We’re lucky that here, in Nottinghamshire’s historic Welbeck estate, we get to work with the most amazing community of food producers that call this estate their home. The estate’s food producers share our passion for great food and drink.    
                It means that we can fill our shelves with delicious foods that are largely sourced from the estate or from small regional producers that have the same enthusiasm for fine food. Our Made at Welbeck range includes artisan breads, handcrafted ales, and cheese, as well as milk from the estate’s pedigree dairy herd.
