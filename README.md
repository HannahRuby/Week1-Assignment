Build out the website
Overview
The holding page works great, but we need to start thinking about adding some more content to the page.

A designer has been working on some design assets and style guides, and we'd like you to help us build out the page. Our lead dev has written some rough instructions for you, but you'll need to search for some of the details.

Follow the guide written by the lead dev to build out the website using the design assets and style guide. It gets a bit vague towards the end, but you should be able to figure out what they mean...

We want something that looks like this: Example website

Setting up the page structure
Dev: Hey! Thanks for taking on the website build. I've been writing up some of our plans today, hopefully it helps you get going!

‚õ≥Ô∏è Create a new index.html file, just like the last project, and set up the basic doc structure

We're going to build the rough page structure with HTML, as we interpret it from the design.

‚õ≥Ô∏è Set up the page with three primary sections: header, main, and footer:

```html
<body>
  <header>Header</header>
  <main>Page content</main>
  <footer>Footer</footer>
</body>
```

‚õ≥Ô∏è Use an `<h1>` tag in the header to add the company name, and a `<nav>` tag with some nav links. We'll just point them to # for now.

<header>
  <h1>Company Ltd. Ltd.</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="#">Home</a>
    <a href="#">About</a>
    <a href="#">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>

‚õ≥Ô∏è Add a `<section>` tag to the main content, with the class of `feature`. This will contain our featured post content, and display our large background images. Inside it, add an `<h2>` tag for the section subtitle (the smaller heading), and a `<h1>` tag for the section title (the larger heading). These can be in any order you like, and each section can have it's own `<h1>`. Also, group the h2 and h1 in a `<div>`, so we can position them together. While you're there, add the "read more" `<a href>` as well.

```html
<main>
  <section class="feature">
    <div class="title">
      <h2>Featured Post</h2>
      <h1>How to make a splash page</h1>
      <a href="#">Read more</a>
    </div>
  </section>
</main>
```

Next we'll start styling those full page images.

Adding background images
‚õ≥Ô∏è Add a background image to the feature section, using the `background-image` property. You can use the image from the design assets, or use a placeholder image from [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/). Set the height of the section to `100vh`, which is a browser unit that means 100% of the viewport height.

```css
.feature {
  height: 100vh;
  background-image: url("./images/eclipse.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center center;
}
```

üëÄ Play around with the different settings for background-size and background-position to see how they affect the position of the image.

Absolute positioning the titles
The css `position: absolute` property allows us to position an element a specific distance from the top, left, bottom, or right of it's parent element. We can use absolute pixel units, rems, or percentages.

‚õ≥Ô∏è Add the following CSS to the title div to position it near the bottom left corner of the feature section, like the design:

```css
.title {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 50px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

üéØ Continue to add more styles to match the design as closely as possible. Add some more sections by copying the first one. Use CSS classes to style each one differently.

Tips and hints
- Use "Inspect Element" to inspect the example and see what styles are being applied to each element
- Margin and padding is one option for spacing between elements, but there are others supported by flexbox.
- Alignment and consistent spacing between elements is important for a design to look balanced and professional (this can be tricky with text!).

There are many correct ways to achieve the same layout, so experiment and see what works best for you.
